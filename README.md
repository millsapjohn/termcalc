# termcalc: the terminal calculator with unnecessary keybindings
I'm using this project to learn Rust. Here I'm implementing a standard terminal calculator using ratatui.
All digits and common mathematical operators will have custom keybindings so the terminally lazy like myself
don't have to reach all the way to the number row on the keyboard to type a character. I also plan to implement
a mathematical grammar parser, again, as a learning experience.
